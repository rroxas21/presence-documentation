# Presence: Product Overview 1

## Introduction
Presence is a virtual teleportation experience for Apple Vision Pro that simulates being in another environment through immersive technology. In its current version, the application allows users to experience pre-recorded 360° videos of different environments, creating the sensation of being teleported to another place. Our development roadmap includes plans to implement real-time streaming functionality, which will eventually allow users to virtually transport into another user's physical environment in real-time.

## Current Features
- **Pre-recorded Virtual Environments**: Access a library of high-quality 360° video environments
- **Immersive Viewing Experience**: Full spatial audio and visual immersion using Apple Vision Pro capabilities
- **Environment Selection**: Choose from various pre-recorded locations and experiences
- **Spatial Audio**: 3D audio that corresponds to the visual environment
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Simple controls for exploring 360° environments
- **Session Scheduling**: Plan and schedule virtual experiences

## Planned Features
- **Live 360° Video Streaming**: Real-time streaming of another user's environment 
- **Shared Spatial Awareness**: Navigate and interact with objects in the shared virtual space
- **Two-way Communication**: Integrated audio and visual communication between users
- **Environment Mapping**: Accurate recreation of the host's physical space
- **Cross-location Collaboration**: Work together on projects despite physical separation

## Use Cases
- Remote collaboration for design and engineering teams
- Virtual family gatherings and social connections
- Distance education and training
- Remote expert assistance for complex tasks
- Immersive telehealth consultations
- Virtual tourism and location sharing

## Technical Specifications
- **Supported Devices**: Apple Vision Pro
- **Operating System**: visionOS 2.0 or later
- **Internet Requirements**: High-speed connection (minimum 30 Mbps for current features, 50+ Mbps for future streaming)
- **Spatial Requirements**: Minimum 6x6 feet clear space recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB for app, additional space for downloaded environments

## How It Works
Currently, Presence utilizes pre-recorded 360° video environments that are optimized for the Apple Vision Pro. Users can select from a library of environments and be virtually transported to these locations with full visual and audio immersion.

In future versions, Presence will incorporate live streaming technology to capture and transmit 360° video from one user's environment to another in real-time, creating a true virtual teleportation experience between users.

## Current Limitations
- Limited to pre-recorded environments
- No real-time interaction with other users
- Downloaded content requires significant storage space

## Development Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Pre-recorded 360° environment experiences
- **Phase 2**: Implementation of 360° video capture and streaming capabilities
- **Phase 3**: Addition of real-time user interaction and collaboration features
- **Phase 4**: Enhanced environment mapping and object interaction

## Version History
- **0.9.0 (Beta)** - Initial release with pre-recorded environment functionality
- [Future versions to be added]
