   ```swift
   Text(debugMessage)
       .foregroundColor(.white)
       .padding()
       .background(Color.black.opacity(0.7))
       .cornerRadius(8)
       .position(x: 200, y: 200) // Position for visibility
   ```

2. **Debug Entity Creation**:
   - Add detailed logging to the RealityView content creation:
   ```swift
   RealityView { content in
       do {
           let sphere = ModelEntity(
               mesh: .generateSphere(radius: 100),
               materials: [SimpleMaterial(color: .blue, roughness: 0.0, isMetallic: false)]
           )
           sphere.scale = .init(x: -1, y: 1, z: 1)
           content.add(sphere)
           print("Sphere created and added successfully")
       } catch {
           print("Failed to create entity: \(error)")
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Test with Xcode Debugger**:
   - Set breakpoints in key functions like `playVideo` and `applyVideoTexture`
   - Inspect variables at runtime to identify the source of issues
   - Use the Debug Navigator to monitor memory and CPU usage

### Video Resource Issues

#### Diagnosing Texture Creation Problems

**Symptoms**:
- Video loads but doesn't appear on the sphere
- Texture creation fails
- Material updates not visible

**Solutions**:
1. **Debug Texture Creation Process**:
   - Add detailed logging to the `createTexture` method in Immersive360View:
   ```swift
   private func createTexture(from pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer) throws -> TextureResource {
       let ciImage = CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer)
       let context = CIContext(options: nil)
       
       print("Creating texture from pixel buffer: \(CVPixelBufferGetWidth(pixelBuffer))x\(CVPixelBufferGetHeight(pixelBuffer))")
       
       guard let cgImage = context.createCGImage(ciImage, from: ciImage.extent) else {
           print("Failed to create CGImage")
           throw NSError(domain: "Failed to create CGImage", code: 2)
       }
       
       print("CGImage created successfully")
       
       do {
           let texture = try TextureResource(image: cgImage, options: .init(semantic: .color))
           print("TextureResource created successfully")
           return texture
       } catch {
           print("Failed to create TextureResource: \(error)")
           throw error
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Test with Different Video Formats**:
   - Convert your video to different resolutions and formats
   - Try both H.264 and HEVC encoded videos
   - Test with square power-of-two textures if possible (e.g., 2048x1024)

3. **Validate with Static Image**:
   - Replace video with a static image texture for testing:
   ```swift
   if let image = UIImage(named: "TestPattern360"), let cgImage = image.cgImage {
       let texture = try? TextureResource(image: cgImage, options: .init(semantic: .color))
       if let texture = texture {
           var material = SimpleMaterial()
           material.color = .init(texture: .init(texture))
           sphere.model?.materials = [material]
       }
   }
   ```

#### Optimizing Video Performance

**Symptoms**:
- High CPU/GPU usage
- Frame drops during playback
- Memory warnings or crashes during long sessions

**Solutions**:
1. **Profile with Instruments**:
   - In Xcode, select Product > Profile (Cmd+I)
   - Choose the "Time Profiler" instrument
   - Launch on your device and capture performance data
   - Look for hot spots in the video processing code

2. **Optimize Frame Extraction**:
   - Add frame dropping logic to the VideoUpdater:
   ```swift
   private var lastFrameTime: CFTimeInterval = 0
   
   @objc private func updateFrame() {
       let currentTime = CACurrentMediaTime()
       // Only process frames at 30fps max
       if currentTime - lastFrameTime < 0.033 {
           return
       }
       lastFrameTime = currentTime
       
       // Rest of the update logic...
   }
   ```

3. **Monitor Memory Usage**:
   - Add memory tracking to help diagnose leaks:
   ```swift
   func printMemoryUsage() {
       var info = mach_task_basic_info()
       var count = mach_msg_type_number_t(MemoryLayout<mach_task_basic_info>.size)/4
       
       let kerr: kern_return_t = withUnsafeMutablePointer(to: &info) {
           $0.withMemoryRebound(to: integer_t.self, capacity: Int(count)) {
               task_info(mach_task_self_,
                         task_flavor_t(MACH_TASK_BASIC_INFO),
                         $0,
                         &count)
           }
       }
       
       if kerr == KERN_SUCCESS {
           print("Memory in use (MB): \(info.resident_size / 1024 / 1024)")
       }
   }
   ```

### Performance Analysis

#### Frame Rate Analysis

**Symptoms**:
- User reports of stuttering
- Inconsistent playback speed
- Slow response to head movements

**Solutions**:
1. **Add FPS Counter**:
   - Implement a simple FPS counter in Immersive360View:
   ```swift
   @State private var frameTime: Double = 0
   @State private var frameCount: Int = 0
   @State private var fps: Double = 0
   
   // Add to the body
   .onAppear {
       Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1.0, repeats: true) { _ in
           fps = Double(frameCount)
           frameCount = 0
       }
   }
   
   // Update in your display link or frame update
   frameCount += 1
   
   // Display in your UI
   Text("FPS: \(Int(fps))")
       .foregroundColor(.white)
       .padding(4)
       .background(Color.black.opacity(0.7))
       .cornerRadius(4)
       .position(x: 100, y: 50)
   ```

2. **Use Xcode Gauges**:
   - Enable the FPS gauge in Xcode's Debug Navigator
   - Monitor CPU, GPU, and memory usage in real-time
   - Look for correlations between drops in FPS and specific operations

3. **Profile with Metal System Trace**:
   - Use Instruments with the Metal System Trace template
   - Identify GPU bottlenecks and texture upload delays
   - Look for frame timing issues

#### Memory Leak Detection

**Symptoms**:
- Increasing memory usage over time
- Performance degradation during extended sessions
- App crashes after running for a while

**Solutions**:
1. **Use Instruments Memory Graph**:
   - In Xcode, select Debug > Debug Workflow > View Memory Graph
   - Look for objects with unexpected retain counts
   - Check for reference cycles involving the VideoStreamManager, CADisplayLink, or AVPlayer

2. **Add Deallocation Logging**:
   - Add print statements to deinit methods to verify cleanup:
   ```swift
   deinit {
       print("VideoStreamManager being deallocated")
       cleanupCurrentPlayback()
   }
   ```

3. **Test with Repeated Scene Changes**:
   - Create a test that repeatedly opens and closes the immersive space
   - Monitor memory usage to detect leaks
   - Look for objects that aren't being released properly

By following these troubleshooting steps, both users and developers should be able to identify and resolve most issues with the Presence application.
